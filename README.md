# DJS02 Project Brief: Whole Number Divider


#### Starter Code

The provided HTML and JavaScript setup a basic form for inputting two numbers (dividend and divider) and a button to perform the calculation. The current script captures form submissions and displays the division result. However, it lacks validation, error handling, and the logic to meet all user stories.

#### Division Calculator
This is a simple division calculator that takes two numbers as input and displays the result of the division. It also includes validation for empty inputs and division by zero.

#### Features

Validates for empty inputs
Validates for division by zero
Displays an error message when an invalid input is provided
Logs an error to the console when an invalid input is provided
Installation
To use this calculator, simply include the index.html file in your project and open it in a web browser.

##### Usage

To use the calculator, enter two numbers in the input fields and click the "Divide" button. The result of the division will be displayed below the input fields.

If either or both of the input fields are empty, an error message will be displayed indicating that both values are required. If the second input field is zero, an error message will be displayed indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

If either or both of the input fields contain a value that is not a number, the entire screen will be replaced with the message "Something critical went wrong. Please reload the page" and an error will be logged to the console.
